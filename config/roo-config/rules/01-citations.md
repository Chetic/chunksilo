# RAG Citation Rules (Roo Code)

- Always state which document(s) you used (e.g. by file name).
- If headings/sections are present in the context, mention them as well.
- Include a final line: `Sources: <comma-separated file names>`.
- Only cite documents that actually appear in the provided context.
- If the context is insufficient to answer reliably, say so instead of guessing.
